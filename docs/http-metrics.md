# HTTP metrics

Lens exports Prometheus metrics for the HTTP layer on the existing public
`/metrics` route, alongside the ingestion and database metrics defined in
[`src/metrics.ts`](../src/metrics.ts). The ingestion metrics have their own doc
— [`ingest-metrics.md`](ingest-metrics.md) — because the label constraint there
is different: they are labelled by `network` so the per-network ingester loops
cannot overwrite each other's series.

Request rate, error rate, latency, authentication failures and load shedding
help answer "is the API healthy". The pre-existing `price_requests_total`
counts price calls specifically and cannot answer that question; it is
unchanged and still means what it always meant.

The same cardinality rule applies to every metric family: labels must come from
fixed buckets or server-defined values. Never put raw request paths, asset
codes, issuer addresses, query values or websocket subscription strings in a
Prometheus label.

## What is exported

### `http_requests_total`

Counter. Labels: `method`, `route`, `status_class`.

| Label | Values | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `method` | `GET`, `POST`, … | The HTTP method. |
| `route` | `/price/:assetA/:assetB`, `/status`, … | The matched Fastify route **template**, never the resolved URL. Unrouted requests get the literal `unmatched`. |
| `status_class` | `2xx`, `3xx`, `4xx`, `5xx` | The status class, not the exact code. |

### `http_request_duration_seconds`

Histogram. Labels: `method`, `route`.

Buckets: `0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10`.

Observed for every request that produces a response, successful or not.

### `api_key_auth_failures_total`

Counter. Label: `reason`, with the bounded values `missing`, `malformed`,
`unknown`, `revoked` and `expired`. The `reason` value matches the
machine-readable `code` in the corresponding API-key 401 response.

### `admin_auth_failures_total`

Counter. No labels. This tracks rejected authentication attempts on admin
routes independently of API-key failures.

### Rate-limit counters

`rate_limit_rejections_total` is a counter labelled by the bounded `scope`
values `key` and `ip`; it counts requests rejected by the per-key or fallback
IP limiter. Those requests return HTTP 429 and code `PER_KEY_RATE_LIMITED` or
`IP_RATE_LIMITED`.

`global_shed_requests_total` is an unlabeled counter for requests shed by the
per-instance global ceiling. Those requests return HTTP 503 with code
`GLOBAL_RATE_LIMITED`.

Authentication metrics never include keys, hashes, tokens, key prefixes or
caller addresses as labels.

## Global request ceiling

`GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` configures the maximum accepted non-health requests
per rolling 60-second window on each instance; it defaults to `1000` and must
be a positive integer. The global check runs after the per-key/IP limiter, so
per-key 429 responses remain distinct and are not counted against the global
ceiling.

At 80% of the ceiling, rounded up, the service starts shedding expensive
route templates (GraphQL, price, route, pools, candles, history, screener,
benchmark, oracle, compare, basket, venues, spreads, volumes, book, verify
and settle) to preserve room for other routes. Once the ceiling is full, it
sheds all non-health routes.
`/status`, `/live` and `/ready` are always exempt. Shed requests include a
`Retry-After` header.

The ceiling is **per instance**, not deployment-wide. With `N` equally
configured instances the approximate aggregate ceiling is
`GLOBAL_RATE_LIMIT_MAX x N`; choose the per-instance value based on instance
capacity and expected autoscaling so scaling out does not imply a higher
deployment-wide traffic budget than intended.

## Why the labels look like this

Cardinality is the whole design constraint. A histogram labelled by `req.url`
would mint a new time series for every asset pair, every address and every
cursor Lens is asked about — an unbounded set driven by callers, which
eventually degrades the Prometheus instance scraping it.

So:

- **`route` is the route template.** Fastify exposes the matched route on
  `req.routeOptions.url`; that is what is used. 100 requests to 100 distinct
  addresses produce **one** series, not 100 — asserted in
  [`tests/httpMetrics.test.ts`](../tests/httpMetrics.test.ts).
- **Unmatched requests collapse to `unmatched`.** A 404 uses the literal string
  rather than the raw path, so a scanner probing a thousand URLs cannot mint a
  thousand series.
- **`status_class`, not `status`.** This bounds the series count at
  `methods x routes x 5` rather than `methods x routes x ~60`. If a concrete
  need for an exact code appears, add it then — it is easy to add a label and
  painful to remove one dashboards depend on.
- **Websocket pairs use fixed buckets.** `ws_clients_total`,
  `ws_messages_sent_total`, `ws_messages_dropped_total` and
  `ws_clients_dropped_total` retain their `pair` label, but pair-specific
  subscriptions are recorded as `other`; `*` remains the aggregate across all
  subscriptions. Arbitrary pair names and issuer addresses stay in fanout state
  only and cannot create Prometheus series. `ws_buffered_bytes` is aggregate-only
  (`*`): one series per connected client would be unbounded cardinality driven by
  caller-supplied subscription strings. See
  [`websocket-backpressure.md`](websocket-backpressure.md).

## Excluded routes

`/metrics`, `/live` and `/ready` are not counted at all (`EXCLUDED_ROUTES` in
[`src/middleware/httpMetrics.ts`](../src/middleware/httpMetrics.ts)). Each is
polled on a fixed interval — by the scraper for the first, by the platform for
the other two — so counting any of them would have the poller continuously
inflate the very numbers it is reading. Request rate could never fall to zero on
an idle service, and a real outage could not move it, which is the opposite of
what these two metrics are for. See [`health.md`](health.md).

## Bucket choice

The prom-client defaults cluster below 1s and suit fast in-process handlers.
Lens handlers are not that: a request does a Redis cache lookup (single-digit
ms) or, on a miss, a Postgres aggregate query plus — for `/price` and `/route` —
Horizon/Soroswap network round-trips.

The buckets therefore give resolution in two regions:

- **5ms–50ms** — cache hits, the common fast path. Enough granularity to see the
  Redis path regress before users notice.
- **100ms–2.5s** — DB aggregates and upstream venue calls. This is where p95
  actually lives and where an SLO would be set.

The 5s and 10s buckets catch upstream stalls short of a timeout. Anything slower
lands in `+Inf` and surfaces as a saturated p99.

## Registration order

The hook is registered **first** in [`src/index.ts`](../src/index.ts) — ahead of
the network selector, API-key auth, the rate limiter and x402.

This matters. All of those reject requests from an `onRequest` hook, and Fastify
runs `onRequest` hooks in registration order. Registering the metrics plugin
later would mean a request rejected by auth or x402 short-circuits before the
timer starts, losing exactly the 401/402/429 traffic an operator most wants to
see.

`/metrics` itself is excluded from counting. It is scraped on a fixed interval,
so counting it would have the scraper continuously inflate the numbers it is
reading — request rate would never fall to zero on an idle service. `/live` and
`/ready` are excluded for the same reason, polled by a different timer.

## Queries

```promql
# Request rate (per second, 5m window)
sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (route)

# Error rate as a fraction of all requests
sum(rate(http_requests_total{status_class="5xx"}[5m]))
  / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

# p95 latency across the service
histogram_quantile(0.95,
  sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))

# p95 latency per route — find which endpoint is slow
histogram_quantile(0.95,
  sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le, route))
```

## Suggested alerts

These are starting points; tune the thresholds against observed traffic before
paging anyone with them.

```yaml
groups:
  - name: lens-http
    rules:
      - alert: LensHighErrorRate
        expr: |
          sum(rate(http_requests_total{status_class="5xx"}[5m]))
            / sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) > 0.05
        for: 10m
        labels: { severity: critical }
        annotations:
          summary: "Lens is serving over 5% 5xx"

      - alert: LensHighLatencyP95
        expr: |
          histogram_quantile(0.95,
            sum(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)) > 2.5
        for: 15m
        labels: { severity: warning }
        annotations:
          summary: "Lens p95 latency above 2.5s"

      - alert: LensNoTraffic
        expr: sum(rate(http_requests_total[10m])) == 0
        for: 15m
        labels: { severity: warning }
        annotations:
          summary: "Lens is serving no requests — check ingress or the scraper"
```

A note on `LensHighErrorRate`: the ratio is undefined when there is no traffic,
which is why `LensNoTraffic` exists separately rather than trying to make one
rule cover both. A service serving zero requests is a real problem that an error
*ratio* will never fire on.
