/**
 * Websocket backpressure policy.
 *
 * `WebSocket#send()` neither blocks nor throws when the peer is merely slow —
 * it queues. A client on a bad mobile connection, or one whose process has been
 * suspended, accumulates price updates in its socket's internal buffer, and
 * nothing inspects `bufferedAmount`, so that buffer has no upper bound. With a
 * price feed running continuously, one stuck subscriber is enough to grow the
 * process until it is OOM-killed, taking every other subscriber with it.
 *
 * The policy, in three tiers, is implemented in `FanOutManager.deliver`:
 *
 *  1. **Coalesce** — past {@link BackpressureLimits.slowClientBufferBytes}, or
 *     inside the coalescing window, keep only the newest update and drop the
 *     ones it supersedes. For a price feed an intermediate tick that arrives
 *     late is worthless: the newest tick has already superseded it, so the
 *     backlog is truncated rather than drained. This is the tier that actually
 *     saves a healthy-but-slow client, and the one most clients hit.
 *  2. **Disconnect** — past {@link BackpressureLimits.maxBufferedBytes}, close
 *     the socket with {@link CLOSE_CODE_SLOW_CONSUMER}. No amount of coalescing
 *     fixes a peer that has stopped reading entirely; what bounds it is not
 *     letting its buffer grow.
 *  3. **Evict** — congested for longer than
 *     {@link BackpressureLimits.maxCongestedMs}, close it too. Tier 1 bounds the
 *     memory such a client costs; this bounds the time. Without it a client that
 *     stopped reading holds its slot, its buffered bytes and a
 *     `ws_clients_total` series forever, and nothing would say why.
 *
 * A stalled client can never affect another one: the thresholds are read per
 * client, dropping one only touches that client's own socket, and every send is
 * individually guarded.
 *
 * Resolved once at import (see `FanOutManager`), because this is read on the
 * price-update path.
 */

/**
 * RFC 6455 §7.4.1 code 1013, "Try Again Later". The condition is the client's
 * rather than the server's, but the meaning to a client is the one it already
 * handles for a throttled feed: reconnect, do not treat the close as fatal.
