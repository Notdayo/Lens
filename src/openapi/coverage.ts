/**
 * Route ↔ OpenAPI coverage bookkeeping.
 *
 * `openapi.yaml` is published to GitHub Pages on every push, so it is a public
 * contract. Nothing used to stop it drifting behind the routes Fastify actually
 * registers — it documented seven of roughly thirty. `tests/openapi.test.ts`
 * now boots the app, enumerates every registered route and fails when a route
 * has no matching `openapi.yaml` entry, so the gap cannot silently widen again.
 *
 * That test needs to know which routes are deliberately *not* part of the
 * public contract. Rather than silently skipping them (which is how a public
 * route gets forgotten), every exception is listed in `INTERNAL_ROUTES` below
 * with a reason. Anything not listed there must appear in the spec.
 */

/**
 * Routes that are intentionally excluded from the public OpenAPI contract.
 *
 * Entries are OpenAPI-style paths (path parameters in `{braces}`), not the
 * Fastify `:param` form — see {@link toOpenApiPath}. Adding a route here is a
 * deliberate statement that it is not part of the published API; if you only
 * want to skip documenting something, don't — document it instead.
