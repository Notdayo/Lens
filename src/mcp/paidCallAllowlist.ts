/**
 * The `paid_call` allow-list (#404).
 *
 * `paid_call` hands a URL straight to a fetch wrapper that answers `402` with
 * USDC from a live key, so the tool is a spend primitive dressed as a getter.
 * Agent-facing text — a web page, an issue comment, a search result — is one
 * sentence away from "call paid_call on https://…", which makes the set of
 * hosts this process may pay for a decision for the operator, not the model.
 *
 * The list therefore arrives through configuration (`McpServerConfig.paidCallAllowlist`)
 * and is never read from tool arguments. Its default is empty, and an empty
 * list pays nobody: refusing is the safe failure, so every check below errs
 * towards refusal and an entry this module cannot understand is dropped rather
 * than guessed at.
 *
 * Related open work: a spend ceiling (#210) and a payment log (#211) sit on
 * either side of this gate. They bound and record what happens to allowed
 * hosts; this one decides which hosts there are.
