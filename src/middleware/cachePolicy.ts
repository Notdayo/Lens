 * Per-route Cache-Control policy (issue #266).
 *
 * Every route sends a deliberate `Cache-Control` header:
 * - Live prices get a short max-age — they move every few seconds.
 * - `/pairs` and `/pools` change only when a pool is added — rarely — so
 *   they get a medium max-age.
 * - `/candles` for a closed historical window is *probably* immutable (see
 *   `candlesPolicy` for why "probably" matters); the currently-forming
 *   window is not.
 * - Per-caller responses (usage, admin) are `no-store` — they must never sit
 *   in a shared cache keyed by URL.
 * - Mutations and error responses are `no-store`.
 *
 * Vary: the Stellar network is resolved from the `?network=` query param
 * (part of the URL, hence part of the cache key) OR the `x-network` header
 * (NOT part of the cache key). Every `public` response therefore sends
 * `Vary: x-network` — without it, a shared cache could serve a mainnet
 * response to a testnet request.
 *
 * x402: routes behind the x402 payment gate (`/price*`, `/pools*`,
 * `/candles*`, see GATED_ROUTES in `./x402`) return the same market data
 * regardless of who pays — the response does not vary by payer identity, so
 * no `Vary` on payment headers is needed. But when x402 gating is active,
 * these routes use `private` instead of `public`: a shared cache serving a
 * paid response would let the next caller skip payment entirely, a direct
 * revenue leak. When x402 is not configured, `public` is safe and used.
 *
 * The policy is documented beside each route in `openapi.yaml` (see the
 * `Cache-Control` response header and the "Cache policy" section in the
 * spec's info description).
 */

/**
 * Cache policy for `/candles/:assetA/:assetB`.
 *
 * A window whose `to` is at least one full interval in the past is *probably*
 * closed: no new price point should land in it. But "probably" is doing real
 * work here — backfill and reconciliation jobs can rewrite historical buckets
 * (late-arriving trades, corrections). We therefore do NOT treat closed
 * windows as immutable: they get a short max-age (1h) so a rewrite propagates
 * quickly, plus a long `stale-while-revalidate` (24h) so repeat requests stay
 * fast while revalidation happens in the background. If backfill-driven
 * rewrites are ever ruled out for a deployment, the max-age can be raised.
