/**
 * `/live` and `/ready` — the two health probes a platform needs.
 *
 * `/status` answers a different question and does not substitute for either:
 * it reads `indexer_state`, so it fails when the database is down, and it says
 * nothing about whether this process has finished booting. A platform needs to
 * distinguish "kill and restart this one" from "stop sending traffic here".
 *
 * Both are public and allow-listed from rate limiting, like `/status`: they are
 * polled by infrastructure, often from several addresses at once, and a 429
 * during an incident would remove the instance from rotation precisely when its
 * health matters most. Both are also excluded from HTTP metrics — a fixed-
 * interval poller would otherwise inflate the very request-rate numbers it is
 * reading (see EXCLUDED_ROUTES in src/middleware/httpMetrics.ts).

   * restart every instance during a database outage.
   *
   * Answering at all *is* the liveness signal — the handler runs on the event

   * operator watching a restart loop can tell restarts apart from a stuck
   * process at a glance.
