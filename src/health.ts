 * Liveness and readiness.
 *
 * These answer two different questions and conflating them is what makes a
 * platform restart healthy processes:
 *
 *  - **liveness** (`/live`) — is this process wedged and in need of a kill? It
 *    must not touch Postgres or Redis. If it did, a database blip would fail
 *    liveness on every instance at once and the orchestrator would restart the
 *    entire fleet, turning a dependency outage into a cold-start storm.
 *  - **readiness** (`/ready`) — should this process receive traffic yet? It must
 *    reflect real dependencies and real boot state.
 *
 * The boot state matters because `app.listen()` happens part-way through
 * `main()` (src/index.ts), before the ingesters, the retention worker and the
 * websocket fan-out have started. Between listening and those loops running the
 * process answers requests but cannot actually serve prices, so readiness has
 * to stay false until the boot sequence finishes.
