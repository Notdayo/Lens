/**
 * Enforce process.env isolation across the suite.
 *
 * Root cause of intermittent auth.test.ts / pairs.test.ts (and rotating
 * victims like networkVenueConfig.test.ts) failures: Vitest 4's default pool
 * is already `forks`, so files do not run concurrently in one process. What
 * leaks instead is `process.env` *within* a fork - a reused child process runs
 * several files sequentially, so a key one file sets is still set when the
 * next file starts, and any suite that assumes a clean environment fails
 * depending on the order the files happen to be scheduled in.
 *
 * This setup file snapshots `process.env` before every test and restores it
 * afterwards so mutations cannot leak to the next test in the same worker.
 * Combined with `pool: 'forks'` in vitest.config.ts (separate process per
 * concurrent file), cross-file leakage is eliminated without giving up
 * file parallelism.
